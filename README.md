# AES-256 File Encryptor: Secure Your Files with Ease

This project is a user-friendly desktop application built using Python's `tkinter` library to encrypt files securely with AES-256 encryption. It leverages the `pyzipper` library to create password-protected ZIP archives, ensuring that sensitive files remain secure. The application provides a simple GUI interface for selecting files, entering passwords, and initiating the encryption process.
